# URL Phishing Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for identifying phishing URLs using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models. The project leverages Weights and Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking and model management.

## Introduction
Phishing is a cyber attack that uses disguised emails, websites, or messages to trick users into divulging sensitive information. This project aims to classify URLs as either phishing or legitimate using machine learning models. The models used in this project are Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `urlset.csv`, which contains URLs labeled as phishing or not. The dataset is stored in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Decision Tree
The Decision Tree model is implemented in the `Weights & Biases Phishing Decision Trees.ipynb` file. This script includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and logging the results to Weights and Biases.

## Logistic Regression
The Logistic Regression model is implemented in the `Weights&Biases Assignment.ipynb` file. This script includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and logging the results to Weights and Biases.

## Results
The results of the model training and evaluation, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics, are tracked and visualized on Weights and Biases. You can view the project dashboard and results through the report in this repository.
